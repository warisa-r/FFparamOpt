# Initial Tasks

- [ ] Test NVE simulation on lammps
- [ ] Test if electric field influence the behavior of the molecules
- [ ] check QEq vs acks2: DFT theory? https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10392137
- [ ] See what happens after turning on the electric field on energy minimized structure
- [ ] See what happens to energy minimization with and without efield
- [ ] Use charge equilibration with other models with charges?

- Meeting with Professor Abhishek
